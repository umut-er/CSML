# Cool Suggestions / Research Topics
- Look into serialization. There may be many strategies with this, one of them is the java way of complete control over reading the input stream. That can be done with maybe an additional server paradigm.

# Plans

- Add some type of `Player` of `Client` class with a secret state which involves some type of authentication
- Custom Define a way to generate codes from incoming message
- Check for memory safety at some point maybe potentially?
- Make private calls more intelligable by adding '_' as a prefix
    - Make a map of the interface you want the users to access and make a markdown file explaining it.
- Potentially add a mechanism in which a lobby can send all clients a message.
- Add a check vs. users trying to add multiple responses maybe ? Or should I allow it ? Maybe optional ?
- Maybe clear out some of these assert statements.
- Consts (especially for void*'s)
- Implement a default lobby.

# TODO
- When a client quits, remove them from all lobbies
- Deprecate get_lobby_index from CSML_Server.
